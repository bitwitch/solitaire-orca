TODO:
[ ] make all menu buttons full width of the menu (if not possible add to orca
    wishlist)
[ ] animate drawing from stock to waste?
[X] make a menu
	[ ] describe controls
	[X] switch between draw 1 and draw 3 modes
	[X] change what how to play displays based on game mode
	[X] show rules
	[X] new game
	[X] choose card back
[ ] shift+alt+2 to trigger win animation
[ ] add some sound
[ ] on tableau when dropping a card, if it overlaps both a pile and an empty
    slot and can go in both, prefer the pile

DONE:
[X] draw 3 mode
	[X] clicking the stock will deal 3 cards to the waste pile
	[X] only kings can go in an empty tableau pile
[X] restart button (maybe, we already have r key to restart)
[X] bug: right clicking a face down ace on top of the stock transfers it to
    foundation face down
[X] animation on game end (oldschool windows solitaire style)
[X] animate cards when autocompleting
[X] animate cards when moving to new target
[X] card dealing animation
[X] make right click also auto transfer cards to foundation (nova said old solitaire
    on windows used right click) 
[X] allow the dragging card to act as hitbox when dropping on a new pile instead
		of the mouse. sometimes it feels bad when the card is being dropped on the
    new pile, but the mouse position is not intersecting the new pile
[X] if all cards are turned face up and all cards in tableau are in order,
    autocomplete
[X] allow user to change card backs
[X] on screen resize, need to recalculate all cards positions
[X] moving a card from tableau into foundation works, but then you cannot move the
    card on foundation anymore (moving from waste to foundation works fine and you
	  can move then card on foundation)
	  also you cant put the next card on top of it (i test with gettng up to 6 and 7
    wouldnt go)
[X] if card is clicked (not dragged) move it to foundation if valid
