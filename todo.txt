TODO:
[ ] shift+alt+2 to trigger win animation
[ ] add some sound
[ ] restart button (maybe, we already have r key to restart)
[ ] make a menu
	[ ] describe controls
	[ ] maybe describe rules
	[ ] new game
	[ ] choose card back
[ ] on tableau when dropping a card, if it overlaps both a pile and an empty
    slot and can go in both, prefer the pile

DONE:
[X] animation on game end (oldschool windows solitaire style)
[X] animate cards when autocompleting
[X] animate cards when moving to new target
[X] card dealing animation
[X] make right click also auto transfer cards to foundation (nova said old solitaire
    on windows used right click) 
[X] allow the dragging card to act as hitbox when dropping on a new pile instead
		of the mouse. sometimes it feels bad when the card is being dropped on the
    new pile, but the mouse position is not intersecting the new pile
[X] if all cards are turned face up and all cards in tableau are in order,
    autocomplete
[X] allow user to change card backs
[X] on screen resize, need to recalculate all cards positions
[X] moving a card from tableau into foundation works, but then you cannot move the
    card on foundation anymore (moving from waste to foundation works fine and you
	  can move then card on foundation)
	  also you cant put the next card on top of it (i test with gettng up to 6 and 7
    wouldnt go)
[X] if card is clicked (not dragged) move it to foundation if valid
